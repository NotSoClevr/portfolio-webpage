Portfolio Webpage project required for freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Certification - completed on Sept. 18, 2024
I am still working on this to use as my personal portfolio. The projects listed are projects that I plan to do and link to once they are completed. I will also add a screenshot of each project to make my porfolio look better and to have a preview of each project. 
Currently the only projects listed that are complete and are the survey and TODO app. 
I am focusing on learning so this will take some time to complete, especially since I have a lot to learn in order to begin the larger projects I want to do such as the search engine.
